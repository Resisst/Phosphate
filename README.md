Phosphate will obfuscate your code to make it harder for attackers to recover and/or steal your code.
<br>
Phosphate does not obfuscate imports so that your code can still be compiled into an executable.

Download the source code and add your python file which you would like to obfuscate into the same directory as both the main.py and phosphate.py
<br>
<br>
Open the main.py and input the name of your file

<br>
You should see a new obfuscated file be created which will have the same functionality as your original file
